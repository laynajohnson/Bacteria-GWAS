## Antibiotic Resistance and Susceptibility

One of the most relevant items to understand is the idea of antibiotic resistance (and susceptibility) and why this is an important topic in public health. According to the CDC, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent problems humans are facing. AMR happens when the bacteria (or other organism) develop ways of resisting the antibiotics that previously worked to kill them, therefore ridding the host of the disease they caused (CDC). This is related to the term MIC we touched on earlier and will explain more later. The more resistant a bacteria is, the higher the MIC needed to treat infection.

On the other hand, there is the term antibiotic susceptibility. This is the opposite of resistance. Instead of resisting the antibodies and being harder to treat, the bacteria instead react in the way a doctor would hope when they prescribe antibiotics. The bacteria is not able to fight back and they succumb to the antibodies because they are susceptible. In fact, there might even be some interactions between the bacteria and their environment which causes increased susceptibility. If this is the case, a lower MIC would be sufficient to kill off all the bacteria.

## *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

### Gram-Negative Bacteria

*Neisseria gonorrhoeae*  is a class of bacteria called Gram-Negative bacteria (GNB). This is like a fancy way of saying they are naturally antibiotic resistant. These kinds of bacteria are a large problem for public health, which includes the gonorrhea-causing bacteria we focus on here. GNB are characterized by the specialized mechanisms they have that prevent antimicrobials from doing their job. These include things like efflux pumps (which we will talk about later) and degradation enzymes (Oliveira & Reygaert, 2025). 

The mutations occurring in the  *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* (and other) bacteria are considered heritable changes. If there is some “spontaneous mutation” or acquisition of genes from the environment, the bacteria can pass these mutations to the next generation. *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* bacteria is an ideal candidate for transformation, so once these resistance associated mutations are present, transformation helps to spread it to more bacteria (Unemo & Shafer, 2011) . This process of transformation is a form of horizontal gene transfer, which occurs when a bacteria takes in DNA from its environment. The bacteria that has genes encoding resistance can produce and secrete this information into the environment which can then be picked up by another bacteria that previously did not exhibit the resistance (Shaskolskiy et al., 2022). 

### Bacterial Relatedness

When *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* goes through genetic changes either through spontaneous mutation or through absorbing environmental DNA, we can identify which bacteria are related to each other. We can view the population structure of the bacteria through phylogenetic trees.

If you've ever heard of or seen family trees for humans, this is a similar idea. We can trace how bacteria are related to each other through mutations visible in their genomes. Some bacteria can go through multiple mutations in different ways (recombination), which should be corrected for. This essentially means removing isolates from the population of interest that are not related to separate ancestors making the tree much more complicated.

### Efflux Pumps

One of the special mechanisms bacteria can have is called an efflux pump. This mechanism works to pump out unwanted material (antibiotics) from inside the cell wall of the bacteria. When functioning properly, or in a resistant way, they will effectively dispel the antibiotic, allowing the bacteria to survive against many different kinds of antibodies and continue to replicate. In susceptible bacteria, the efflux pump could have experienced something called a Loss of Function (LOF) mutation. This means that the function of pumping out antibiotics has weakened, meaning the bacteria now has a harder time of getting rid of the agent. This mutation is one we are interested in when we think about antimicrobial susceptibility.

With all of this knowledge in mind, this is the question we are answering with our work in the next couple of sections: 

How can we use statistical genetics methods (GWAS) to identify instances of susceptibility to azithromycin in the *N. gonorrhoeae* bacteria?
