title: Conclusion
---

This project was a culmination of our STAT 494 Statistical Gentics course during the spring of 2025. 

Throughout the semester, we learned to engage with recent and diverse literature on GWAS and its applications. For this project, we decided to build on that exposure by diving into an interesting topic, even though we weren’t very familiar with the organism (bacteria instead of humans!). We discovered that in such specialized fields, even general terminology could take on more specific meanings, and it’s easy to assume things are entirely different (sometimes they are since the organisms are different). But when you look more closely, you realize it’s really about decoding the language and finding the connections (though it took a lot of decoding!)

It was so interesting to learn how GWAS is conducted in bacteria, as we could apply much of what we’d learned in class. The paper we chose was challenging, and we had to do a lot of independent research and deep reading. Along the way, we learned a lot, not only about bacteria but also about how GWAS models can be structured and the different approaches to understanding relationships within bacterial populations. Additionally, Preparing our presentation helped us digest the material for our peers, while also clarifying our storyline and giving us direction.

Then came the code, which was another big challenge. The methods used in our reference paper were quite different from what we had learned in class, and much of the code was written in Python, a language we didn’t have much experience with. There were moments when it felt overwhelming, but pushing through those challenges was worth it, and in the end, we were proud of how the Manhattan plot turned out.

Beyond learning about bacterial GWAS, we had a positive experience reaching out to the paper’s lead authors. Through that, we learned more about how science is made accessible, and how we can also contribute to that process as we participate in academic environments. We’re very grateful for their kindness and support in making this project possible.
