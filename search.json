    "text": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n\nGram-Negative Bacteria\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is a class of bacteria called Gram-Negative bacteria (GNB). This is like a fancy way of saying they are naturally antibiotic resistant. These kinds of bacteria are a large problem for public health, which includes the gonorrhea-causing bacteria we focus on here. GNB are characterized by the specialized mechanisms they have that prevent antimicrobials from doing their job. These include things like efflux pumps (which we will talk about later) and degradation enzymes (Oliveira & Reygaert, 2025).\nThe mutations occurring in the Neisseria gonorrhoeae (and other) bacteria are considered heritable changes. If there is some “spontaneous mutation” or acquisition of genes from the environment, the bacteria can pass these mutations to the next generation. Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria is an ideal candidate for transformation, so once these resistance associated mutations are present, transformation helps to spread it to more bacteria (Unemo & Shafer, 2011) . This process of transformation is a form of horizontal gene transfer, which occurs when a bacteria takes in DNA from its environment. The bacteria that has genes encoding resistance can produce and secrete this information into the environment which can then be picked up by another bacteria that previously did not exhibit the resistance (Shaskolskiy et al., 2022).\n\n\nBacterial Relatedness\nWhen Neisseria gonorrhoeae goes through genetic changes either through spontaneous mutation or through absorbing environmental DNA, we can identify which bacteria are related to each other. We can view the population structure of the bacteria through phylogenetic trees.\nHow can we use statistical genetics methods (GWAS) to identify instances of susceptibility to azithromycin in the N. gonorrhoeae bacteria?",

    "text": "The paper Adaptation to the cervical environment is associated with increased antibiotic susceptibility in Neisseria gonorrhoeae had the objective to understand the phenomenon of some Neisseria gonorrhoeae clinical isolates reverting to antibiotic susceptibility despite the general trend of increasing resistance.\nThis objective was broken down into1. A way to assess susceptibility/resistance to different antibiotics (Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Ciprofloxacin) and 2. Trying to identify how well are known genetic markers are predicting that susceptibility/resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n\n\n\n\nThe study utilized Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) as the measure of antibiotic resistance phenotype. MIC is a way to assess how much concentration of certain medicina can cause the inhibition of growth.\nFor example, in the image below we can think of the darker green dots as Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria, and the numbers by the test tubes from 0 to 16 could represent the concentration of Azithromycin since we are focusing on that antibiotic for our project. Susceptible organisms’ communities would decrease in size or disappear as the concentration of antibiotics is higher, whereas the resistant organisms communities are unaffected by the medicine. The more resistant the organism, the higher the MIC and the opposite is true for susceptible organisms.\n\n\n\nMIC example. *Modified by Alayna Jonhson\n\n\nThey assembled a global dataset that included the genomes and associated MICs for 4852 isolates. MICs were log-transformed for use as continuous outcome variables in their analysis.\nThey binarized MICs using clinical breakpoints for visualization based on Neisseria gonorrhoeae phylogeny.\n\n\n\nPhylogeny tree with binarized MIC to show suceptibility or resistance to Azithromycin\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers were interested on how much of the variation in antibiotic resistance phenotype (measured by MICs) was captured by the presence and absence of known resistance markers.\nThey achieved this by modeling log-transformed MICs using multiple regression.\nThese were specific markers in the bacteria’s DNA that scientists had already experimentally confirmed to be linked to resistance. They used a group of these known markers for three important antibiotics used to treat N. gonorrhoeae, and we will be focusing on only one of them: azithromycin. In their models, they also included the country where each bacterial sample was isolated from. This was done to help account for any differences in resistance or genetic patterns that might be related to geographic location.\nSince we are focusing on Azithromycin, this is what their model looked like:\n\n\n\nLinear model before GWAS\n\n\nFrom this model they found that - The predictive modeling of MICs based on known resistance markers explained a relatively low amount of the variance (about 1 in 10 strains had MIC predictions that were way off) (adjusted R² = 0.667) - There was unexplained susceptibility, meaning unknown modifiers that promote susceptibility.\nThey performed bacterial genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to identify these novel loci influencing antibiotic susceptibility in an unbiased way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey employed a linear mixed model framework, which allowed them to account for:\n\nPopulation Structure: They included a random effect based on the bacterial phylogeny (genetic relatedness between isolates) to control for the confounding influence of how different strains are related to each other\nCountry of Origin: They included isolate country of origin as a fixed effect covariate in the model.\n\n\n\n\nThey ran the linear mixed model GWAS using the Pyseer software. They analyzed the association between each unitig (genetic marker) across the genomes and the log-transformed MICs.\n\n\n\nThey used a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold to determine which associations were statistically significant after testing a large number of unitigs.\n\n\n\nSignificant unitigs were mapped to a reference genome and annotated to identify the genes or regions they corresponded to. Unitigs mapping to multiple sites, highly variable genes, or that were too short were excluded. They also grouped closely located, highly significant unitigs.\nThe analysis identified many highly significant unitigs corresponding to known resistance mutations. And more interestingly, it also revealed a highly significant variant associated with increased susceptibility (reflected by a negative effect size on log-transformed MIC values)\nThis susceptibility-linked variant mapped to the mtrC gene. The mtrC loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were associated with increased susceptibility as they lead to worsen response to antibiotics from the N. gonorrhoeae bacteria.\n\n\n\nmtrC variant resulted on mtrC LOF (Loss of function). *Modified by Alayna Jonhson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter identifying and characterizing the mtrC loss-of-function (LOF) mutation as a strong contributor to increased antibiotic susceptibility, the researchers revisited their earlier linear models.\nThey wanted to know: if you take bacterial isolates that already have known resistance mutations, and then check whether the presence of an mtrC LOF mutation is associated with lower MICs.\nThey found a statistically significant association.\nTo quantify the improvement of the model, they updated their original linear models by adding the presence of the mtrC LOF mutation as an additional predictor variable.\n\n\n\nLinear model after GWAS\n\n\nIncluding the mtrC LOF mutations made the models better at explaining variation in MICs for azithromycin. This was shown by an increase in the adjusted R² from 0.667 to 0.704, meaning the models could account for a larger proportion of the differences in MICs across strains.\nAlthough the increase in adjusted R² for azithromycin from 0.667 to 0.704 might seem small, the researchers argued is considered meaningful for many reasons:\n\nCapturing unexplained variation: The initial model left a portion of isolates with lower MICs than expected based on known resistance markers. Including the mtrC LOF mutation helped explain some of this missing variation, directly addressing one of the study’s main goals of identifying hidden susceptibility factors.\nStatistical significance: The improvement in model fit was confirmed through a likelihood-ratio χ² test with a p-value &lt; 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶, making it extremely unlikely that the R² increase was due to random chance. Even modest increases in adjusted R² can be important in biological datasets where phenotypes are influenced by many small factors.\nBiological relevance: Adding the mtrC LOF mutation reduced the proportion of strains with unexplained susceptibility from 5.73% to 3.88% for azithromycin. This means a meaningful number of clinical isolates (dozens out of thousands) were better explained by the model, supporting the biological significance of this identified genetic factor.",

    "text": "After identifying and characterizing the mtrC loss-of-function (LOF) mutation as a strong contributor to increased antibiotic susceptibility, the researchers revisited their earlier linear models.\nThey wanted to know: if you take bacterial isolates that already have known resistance mutations, and then check whether the presence of an mtrC LOF mutation is associated with lower MICs.\nThey found a statistically significant association.\nTo quantify the improvement of the model, they updated their original linear models by adding the presence of the mtrC LOF mutation as an additional predictor variable.\n\n\n\nLinear model after GWAS\n\n\nIncluding the mtrC LOF mutations made the models better at explaining variation in MICs for azithromycin. This was shown by an increase in the adjusted R² from 0.667 to 0.704, meaning the models could account for a larger proportion of the differences in MICs across strains.\nAlthough the increase in adjusted R² for azithromycin from 0.667 to 0.704 might seem small, the researchers argued is considered meaningful for many reasons:\n\nCapturing unexplained variation: The initial model left a portion of isolates with lower MICs than expected based on known resistance markers. Including the mtrC LOF mutation helped explain some of this missing variation, directly addressing one of the study’s main goals of identifying hidden susceptibility factors.\nStatistical significance: The improvement in model fit was confirmed through a likelihood-ratio χ² test with a p-value &lt; 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶, making it extremely unlikely that the R² increase was due to random chance. Even modest increases in adjusted R² can be important in biological datasets where phenotypes are influenced by many small factors.\nBiological relevance: Adding the mtrC LOF mutation reduced the proportion of strains with unexplained susceptibility from 5.73% to 3.88% for azithromycin. This means a meaningful number of clinical isolates (dozens out of thousands) were better explained by the model, supporting the biological significance of this identified genetic factor.",
