    "text": "This project discusses the background behind the methodologies of the paper “Adaptation to the cervical environment is associated with increased antibiotic susceptibility in Neisseria gonorrhoeae” by Ma, K.C., Mortimer, T.D., Hicks, A.L. et al. We are focusing on methods of using GWAS (genome wide association studies) to identify antimicrobial susceptibility in the bacteria that causes the gonorrhea STI: Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Some topics we will cover include explaining population structure of the bacteria, what unitigs are, and how this research uses linear mixed models to predict MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of the antibiotic called azithromycin as it is used against the bacteria.\nThere is much more to learn about the research done by the authors of this paper, and we will only cover a small portion of it. For example, they focus on three different drugs that are commonly used to treat gonorrhea: azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. Additionally, the researchers focus on environmental factors such as where the bacteria is located in the human host as factors impacting the evolutionary traits of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\nTo explore the topics in the part of the paper we are focusing on, visit the different sections of our website. If there is a term you don’t quite understand, check out the vocabulary section.\n\n\nThis repo and GitHub Action was based on the tutorial by Openscapes quarto-website-tutorial by Julia Lowndes and Stefanie Butland.",

    "text": "One of the most relevant items to understand is the idea of antibiotic resistance (and susceptibility) and why this is an important topic in public health. According to the CDC, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent problems humans are facing. AMR happens when the bacteria (or other organism) develop ways of resisting the antibiotics that previously worked to kill them, therefore ridding the host of the disease they caused (CDC). This is related to the term MIC we learned earlier. The more resistant a bacteria is, the higher the MIC needed to treat infection.\nOn the other hand, there is the term antibiotic susceptibility. This is the opposite of resistance. Instead of resisting the antibodies and being harder to treat, the bacteria instead react in the way a doctor would hope when they prescribe antibiotics. The bacteria is not able to fight back and they succumb to the antibodies because they are susceptible. In fact, there might even be some interactions between the bacteria and their environment which causes increased susceptibility. If this is the case, a lower MIC would be sufficient to kill off all the bacteria.",

    "text": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n\nGram-Negative Bacteria\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is a class of bacteria called Gram-Negative bacteria (GNB). This is like a fancy way of saying they are naturally antibiotic resistant. These kinds of bacteria are a large problem for public health, which includes the gonorrhea-causing bacteria we focus on here. GNB are characterized by the specialized mechanisms they have that prevent antimicrobials from doing their job. These include things like efflux pumps (which we will talk about later) and degradation enzymes (Oliveira, J., & Reygaert, W. C).\nThe mutations occurring in the Neisseria gonorrhoeae (and other) bacteria are considered heritable changes. If there is some “spontaneous mutation” or acquisition of genes from the environment, the bacteria can pass these mutations to the next generation. Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria is an ideal candidate for transformation, so once these resistance associated mutations are present, transformation helps to spread it to more bacteria (Unemo, M., & Shafer, W. M.) . This process of transformation is a form of horizontal gene transfer, which occurs when a bacteria takes in DNA from its environment. The bacteria that has genes encoding resistance can shed or expel this information into the environment which can then be picked up by another bacteria that previously did not exhibit the resistance.\n\n\nBacterial Relatedness",
