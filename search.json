    "text": "This project was a culmination of our STAT 494 Statistical Gentics course during the spring of 2025.\nThroughout the semester, we learned to engage with recent and diverse literature on GWAS and its applications. For this project, we decided to build on that exposure by diving into an interesting topic, even though we weren’t very familiar with the organism (bacteria instead of humans!). We discovered that in such specialized fields, even general terminology could take on more specific meanings, and it’s easy to assume things are entirely different (sometimes they are since the organisms are different). But when you look more closely, you realize it’s really about decoding the language and finding the connections (though it took a lot of decoding!)\nIt was so interesting to learn how GWAS is conducted in bacteria, as we could apply much of what we’d learned in class. The paper we chose was challenging, and we had to do a lot of independent research and deep reading. Along the way, we learned a lot, not only about bacteria but also about how GWAS models can be structured and the different approaches to understanding relationships within bacterial populations. Additionally, Preparing our presentation helped us digest the material for our peers, while also clarifying our storyline and giving us direction.\nThen came the code, which was another big challenge. The methods used in our reference paper were quite different from what we had learned in class, and much of the code was written in Python, a language we didn’t have much experience with. There were moments when it felt overwhelming, but pushing through those challenges was worth it, and in the end, we were proud of how the Manhattan plot turned out.\nBeyond learning about bacterial GWAS, we had a positive experience reaching out to the paper’s lead authors. Through that, we learned more about how science is made accessible, and how we can also contribute to that process as we participate in academic environments. We’re very grateful for their kindness and support in making this project possible.\n\nContributions\nA.J. researched and interpreted background information from the original paper. N.B.S interpreted Linear Models for GWAS and explained the motivations and purpose of the methodology. M.S.L translated code from Python to replicate GWAS study for azithromycin on N. gonorrohoeae.",

    "text": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae\n\nGram-Negative Bacteria\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is a class of bacteria called Gram-Negative bacteria (GNB). This is like a fancy way of saying they are naturally antibiotic resistant. These kinds of bacteria are a large problem for public health, which includes the gonorrhea-causing bacteria we focus on here. GNB are characterized by the specialized mechanisms they have that prevent antimicrobials from doing their job. These include things like efflux pumps (which we will talk about later) and degradation enzymes (Oliveira & Reygaert, 2025).\nThe mutations occurring in the Neisseria gonorrhoeae (and other) bacteria are considered heritable changes. If there is some “spontaneous mutation” or acquisition of genes from the environment, the bacteria can pass these mutations to the next generation. Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria is an ideal candidate for transformation, so once these resistance associated mutations are present, transformation helps to spread it to more bacteria (Unemo & Shafer, 2011) . This process of transformation is a form of horizontal gene transfer, which occurs when a bacteria takes in DNA from its environment. The bacteria that has genes encoding resistance can produce and secrete this information into the environment which can then be picked up by another bacteria that previously did not exhibit the resistance (Shaskolskiy et al., 2022).\n\n\nBacterial Relatedness\nWhen Neisseria gonorrhoeae goes through genetic changes either through spontaneous mutation or through absorbing environmental DNA, we can identify which bacteria are related to each other. We can view the population structure of the bacteria through phylogenetic trees.\nIf you’ve ever heard of or seen family trees for humans, this is a similar idea. We can trace how bacteria are related to each other through mutations visible in their genomes. Some bacteria can go through multiple mutations in different ways (recombination), which should be corrected for. This essentially means removing isolates from the population of interest that are not related to separate ancestors making the tree much more complicated.\n\n\nEfflux Pumps\nOne of the special mechanisms bacteria can have is called an efflux pump. This mechanism works to pump out unwanted material (antibiotics) from inside the cell wall of the bacteria. When functioning properly, or in a resistant way, they will effectively dispel the antibiotic, allowing the bacteria to survive against many different kinds of antibodies and continue to replicate. In susceptible bacteria, the efflux pump could have experienced something called a Loss of Function (LOF) mutation. This means that the function of pumping out antibiotics has weakened, meaning the bacteria now has a harder time of getting rid of the agent. This mutation is one we are interested in when we think about antimicrobial susceptibility.\n\n\n\nmtrC variant resulted on mtrC LOF (Loss of function). This image shows on the left a bacteria with a properly functioning efflux pump and on the right one that has experienced a loss of function (LOF) mutation in the area of the genome encoding the mechanism\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all of this knowledge in mind, this is the question we are answering with our work in the next couple of sections:\nHow can we use statistical genetics methods (GWAS) to identify instances of susceptibility to azithromycin in the N. gonorrhoeae bacteria?",

MIC is a way to assess how much concentration of certain medicine can cause the inhibition of growth.\nFor example, in the image below we can think of the darker green dots as Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria, and the numbers by the test tubes from 0 to 16 represent the concentration of the antibody Azithromycin. Susceptible organisms’ communities decrease in size or disappear as the concentration of antibiotics is higher, whereas the resistant organisms communities are unaffected by the medicine. The more resistant the organism, the higher the MIC and the opposite is true for susceptible organisms.\n\n\n\nMIC example.\n\n\nThey assembled a global dataset that included the genomes and associated MICs for 4852 isolates. MICs were log-transformed for use as continuous outcome variables in their analysis.\nThey binarized MICs using clinical breakpoints for visualization based on Neisseria gonorrhoeae phylogeny.\n\n\n\nPhylogenetic tree with binarized MIC to show suceptibility or resistance to Azithromycin.\n\n\n\n\n2. Trying to identify how well known genetic markers predict susceptibility/resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae\nThe researchers were interested on how much of the variation in antibiotic resistance phenotype (measured by MICs) was captured by the presence and absence of known resistance markers.\nThey achieved this by modeling log-transformed MICs using multiple regression.\nThese were specific markers in the bacteria’s DNA that scientists had already experimentally confirmed to be linked to resistance. They used a group of these known markers for three important antibiotics used to treat N. gonorrhoeae, and we will be focusing on only one of them: azithromycin. In their models, they also included the country where each bacterial sample was isolated from. This was done to help account for any differences in resistance or genetic patterns that might be related to geographic location.\nSince we are focusing on Azithromycin, this is what their model looked like:\n\n\n\nLinear model before GWAS\n\n\nFrom this model they found that - The predictive modeling of MICs based on known resistance markers explained a relatively low amount of the variance (about 1 in 10 strains had MIC predictions that were way off) (adjusted R² = 0.667) - There was unexplained susceptibility, meaning unknown modifiers that promote susceptibility.\nThey performed bacterial genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to identify these novel loci influencing antibiotic susceptibility in an unbiased way.",

Statistical Model:\nThey employed a linear mixed model framework, which allowed them to account for:\n\nPopulation Structure: They included a random effect based on the bacterial phylogeny (genetic relatedness between isolates) to control for the confounding influence of how different strains are related to each other\nCountry of Origin: They included isolate country of origin as a fixed effect covariate in the model.\n\n\n\n2. Software and Analysis:\nThey ran the linear mixed model GWAS using the Pyseer software. They analyzed the association between each unitig (genetic marker) across the genomes and the log-transformed MICs.\n\n\n3. Significance Threshold:\nThey used a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold to determine which associations were statistically significant after testing a large number of unitigs.\n\n\n4. Identification and Annotation:\nSignificant unitigs were mapped to a reference genome and annotated to identify the genes or regions they corresponded to. Unitigs mapping to multiple sites, highly variable genes, or that were too short were excluded. They also grouped closely located, highly significant unitigs.\nThe analysis identified many highly significant unitigs corresponding to known resistance mutations. And more interestingly, it also revealed a highly significant variant associated with increased susceptibility (reflected by a negative effect size on log-transformed MIC values)\nThis susceptibility-linked variant mapped to the mtrC gene. The mtrC loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were associated with increased susceptibility as they lead to worsen response to antibiotics from the N. gonorrhoeae bacteria.\n\n\n\nmtrC variant resulted on mtrC LOF (Loss of function).",

    "text": "Post-GWAS Linear Model\nAfter identifying and characterizing the mtrC loss-of-function (LOF) mutation as a strong contributor to increased antibiotic susceptibility, the researchers revisited their earlier linear models.\nThey wanted to know: if you take bacterial isolates that already have known resistance mutations, and then check whether the presence of an mtrC LOF mutation is associated with lower MICs.\nThey found a statistically significant association.\nTo quantify the improvement of the model, they updated their original linear models by adding the presence of the mtrC LOF mutation as an additional predictor variable.\n\n\n\nLinear model after GWAS\n\n\nIncluding the mtrC LOF mutations made the models better at explaining variation in MICs for azithromycin. This was shown by an increase in the adjusted R² from 0.667 to 0.704, meaning the models could account for a larger proportion of the differences in MICs across strains.\nAlthough the increase in adjusted R² for azithromycin from 0.667 to 0.704 might seem small, the researchers argued is considered meaningful for many reasons:\n\nCapturing unexplained variation: The initial model left a portion of isolates with lower MICs than expected based on known resistance markers. Including the mtrC LOF mutation helped explain some of this missing variation, directly addressing one of the study’s main goals of identifying hidden susceptibility factors.\nStatistical significance: The improvement in model fit was confirmed through a likelihood-ratio χ² test with a p-value &lt; 2.2 × 10⁻¹⁶, making it extremely unlikely that the R² increase was due to random chance. Even modest increases in adjusted R² can be important in biological datasets where phenotypes are influenced by many small factors.\nBiological relevance: Adding the mtrC LOF mutation reduced the proportion of strains with unexplained susceptibility from 5.73% to 3.88% for azithromycin. This means a meaningful number of clinical isolates (dozens out of thousands) were better explained by the model, supporting the biological significance of this identified genetic factor.",
